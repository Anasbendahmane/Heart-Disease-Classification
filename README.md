# **Heart Disease Classification Project**

Classify the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes of a patient.

The dataset is obtained from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It has been preprocessed and is ready for use in training a classification model for heart disease prediction.

## DataSet description:
### Data:

  **Age:** Age of the patient.
  
  **Sex:** Gender of the patient.
  
  **exang:** Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
  
  **ca:** Number of major vessels (0-3).
  
  **cp:** Chest Pain type
  
        Value 1: Typical angina
        
        Value 2: Atypical angina
        
        Value 3: Non-anginal pain
        
        Value 4: Asymptomatic
        
  **trtbps:** Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
  
  **chol:** Cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
  
  **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
  
  **rest_ecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results.
  
        Value 0: Normal
        
        Value 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
        
        Value 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
        
  **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved

### Label:
  **output:** 
  
             0 = Absence of heart disease
             1 = Presence of heart disease
